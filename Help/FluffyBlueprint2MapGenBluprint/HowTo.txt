This is a short description about 
how to convert a Blueprint from Fluffy's Blueprint mod 
into a Miscellaneous MapGeneratorFactionBase Blueprint
#########################################################

Note: 
This is Windows only, as I have no knowledge about Linux or MacOS.
If you want to have it for these, use the supplied source code to compile it to your system.     

---------
You need:
---------
- Fluffy's Blueprint mod (from Steam or from here: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=16120.0)
- The Blueprint2MapGenConverter (provided in subfolder)

--------------
How to use it:
--------------
- Create your Base in RimWorld (with dev mode) and save it with the Blueprint mod. Export the blueprint!
- Open Blueprint2MapGenConverter. It will automatically try to set your path -> Savegame-folder -> Blueprints folder
- Press 'Select File' and navigate to the exported blueprint file.
- Press 'Convert File'. Now it will convert the data from the blueprint file into the format needed for the MapGeneratorFactionBase blueprints.
  The converted file gets the Prefix 'MapGenerator_'
- Pressing 'Open Folder' will open the Explorer to the folder with the created file.
- Now you have a file where the Buildings and Floors are already set. You just have to change the Name, devName and createdBy and it is usable.
- You should now at least fill out the itemData / itemLegend section or the blueprint doesn't have any items (Not doable via Fluffy's Blueprint).

- Finally upload your finished blueprint to the GitHub-Repository, or post it in the Miscellaneous page on the forum:
